Hi!

Current config: Android Studio and Kotlin running in Windows 10 and a Motorola G Power phone running Android 11

I have three active pretty primitive apps at Google Play and working on publishing a fourth that is my best yet.

The Kotlin language is beautiful. And the compiler runs ultra fast. One of the things I love about the language is the name taken for functions, though they call them methods. They went with fun! 

I'm looking into getting a database running for my next app, but that is going slow. I finally got a sample Android Open Source Project from GitHub running in the studio that I'm reading now. 

But I still haven't pushed any files over to GitHub. Not that I know of anyway. Thank 

I'll try gist to send some lines over, then to push one app in. One I have is of great interest as a template for future releases. I figured out how to get fragments to slide with active independent toolbars and buttons. 

I do all of my work with the incredible helpful help at developer.android.com, kotlinlang.org, StackOverflow.com. And play.kotlinlang.org is really fun. And now it looks like GitHub has tons of material and help.
